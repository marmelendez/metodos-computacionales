% 9. Write a predicate length2/2 which takes a list as first argument, and returns in the second one the number of elements in the list.

length2([], 0).
length2([_|List], R) :- 
    length2(List, L), 
    R is L + 1.
    
%10. Write a predicate power/3 which takes a number as first argument, a natural number as second argument and returns the first number to the power of the second.

power(0, 0, _):-
    print(error),
	fail.

power(X, 0, 1):-
    X =\= 0.

power(X, Y, Z):-
    Y >= 2, 
    Y_1 is Y - 1,
    power(X, Y_1, Z_1),
    Z is X * Z_1.
